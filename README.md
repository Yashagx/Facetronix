## üîß Modules Overview

### 1. FaceCapture
A high-performance **real-time face detection** module powered by OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifiers.  
- Efficient detection pipeline for live video feeds and static images.  
- Supports face bounding box extraction for downstream processing.

---

### 2. FaceFeel
Emotion recognition module trained on the **FER-2013 dataset**, built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
- Detects and classifies emotions such as *happy, sad, angry, surprise, fear, neutral,* and more.  
- Optimized for real-time inference with high accuracy.

### 3. FaceMeter
Facial landmark and pose estimation using **Google's MediaPipe framework**.  
- Detects 468 facial landmarks with sub-pixel accuracy.  
- Provides head pose estimation and facial feature analysis for advanced applications.

---

### 4. GenAgeNet
A robust **age and gender prediction system** using OpenCV‚Äôs DNN modules.  
- Pretrained deep learning models to estimate approximate age groups and binary gender classification.  
- Designed for demographic analysis in surveillance, marketing, and interactive systems.
